# GraphiQL App ✨

## Overview 🔭

The main purpose of the **GraphiQL App** is to provide you an easy-to-use and robust interactive platform to write, validate and test all kinds of your REST / GraphQL APIs requests.

### Key features: 🔑

- **Testing playground<sup>2<sup>** - you can send requests to APIs, check responses and validate functionality.
- **Nothing will be lost** - all your previous requests will be saved in the history.
- **Handyman** - you can easily customize both the headers and the body of your query.
- **It's not the space shuttle** - simple and intuitive interface.
- **You want it, you got it** - you will get the API schema definition, if available.
